##A5 Reflections
The tool I developed is a desk-checking tool based on criteria from ‘Arbejdstilsynet’, the Danish regulatory authority for workplace environments.
The use case we created in A2 was admittedly chosen haphazardly, despite that, the tool ultimately works quite well and checks exactly what I intended it to.
However, the code has become very specific to this particular model. Instead of functioning as a universal desk-finding tool for any possible IFC model, it only works reliably with this one (25-16-D-ARCH.ifc), which is unfortunate.
There are several uncertainties. For example, the margin of the bounding box is set to 0,5 m, but if another door is close by and not actually an exit, the tool might misidentify it. It’s also necessary to be careful with bounding boxes, bbox, in general, as a flat virtual square can appear as a diamond depending on its orientation however I use it in a 3D dimension ‘IfcSpace’, so that should not be a problem, but for father studies I will try to remember that. 
Many of the limitations comes from the model itself as well as the structure of my code. I wish I had designed the code with more interchangeable variables, for instance, to check chairs or windows, so it could be reused more flexibly.
That said, the tool is very useful in the B-stage and for iterating or counting desks throughout the project.
As for openBIM, I originally expected it to play only a small role in my academic future. However, after the guest lecture about two weeks ago, I am now certain that in my career, at some point, will be connected to openBIM.

Group reflections:
The GitHub collaboration was a less integrated, which is a shame, because I think I will definitely use it in the future. 

Did the tool address the use case we identified? 

Yes, the tool addressed the use case regarding desks as we chose. 
Even though the use case was selected somewhat hastily, the tool still managed to check desks according to the defined criteria as intended and create a detailed list thereof. 
Its main limitation is that it works well only for the specific model we used, rather than being a universal desk-checking tool for any IFC model. 
So it fulfilled the use case, but not the broader goal of flexibility and the ‘openness’.

Which stage does the tool work in within Advanced Building Design?

The tool is most useful in stage B, where iterative testing and compliance checking support the development of the design.
It helps count and validate desk placement in IfcSPaces during these iterations. 
With further refinement it could support parts of stage C, but in its current form it mainly fits stage B.
